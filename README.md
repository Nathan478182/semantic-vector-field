# Semantic Vector Field (SVF) Architecture

This repository contains the whitepaper and supporting material for the 
SVF model â€” a non-parametric, multimodal language model architecture 
that uses geometric token positioning and conceptual vectors.

experiments and architectural structure.
Future code and tokenizer prototypes will be added here.

## Abstract

The SVF (Semantic Vector Field) model replaces traditional neural 
weights and embeddings with structured semantic spaces and vector 
dictionaries. It offers high efficiency, low hallucination rates, 
and natural multimodality across text, image and audio inputs.
